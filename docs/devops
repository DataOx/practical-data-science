wildcard pattern **/*.csproj. Both ** and *.csproj are examples of what are called glob patterns. The ** part specifies to search the current directory and all child directories. The *.csproj part specifies any .csproj file. Wildcards let you act on multiple files without specifying each one. If you need to act on a specific file only, you can specify that file instead of using wildcards.

#value stream map
Creating a value stream map, or VSM, helps you analyze your current release cycle process. The purpose of a VSM is to visually show where in the process a team creates value and where there's waste. The goal, of course, is to arrive at a process that delivers maximum value to the customer with minimum waste. A VSM can help you pinpoint those areas that either don't contribute any value or that actually reduce the value of the product.

    Dark launches
    A/B testing
    Progressive-exposure deployment (ring-based deploymen)
