wildcard pattern **/*.csproj. Both ** and *.csproj are examples of what are called glob patterns. The ** part specifies to search the current directory and all child directories. The *.csproj part specifies any .csproj file. Wildcards let you act on multiple files without specifying each one. If you need to act on a specific file only, you can specify that file instead of using wildcards.
