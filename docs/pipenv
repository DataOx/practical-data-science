How to setup pipenv with vscode

The licencing issue with anaconda makes small teams with limited budget a bit troublesome to use. Thus, we decided to look for a different solution. Pipenv comes in play.

Here shows how to get pipenv up and running in vscode using windows 10.

1) download python from official python website and make sure that python is added to PATH.

2) follow this ref: https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/
We frenquently run into this error:
pipenv : The term 'pipenv' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

Fix: 1) cd to the project folder in vscode and start a powershell.
     2) run py -m site --user-site in the powershell. Then you get results like this: C:\Users\***\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\site-packages. Then replace site-packages with Scripts and add it to path from system environemnts:
       C:\Users\1056673\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts
       Is this is setup correctly, you can run pipenv in the powershell withou any errors.
